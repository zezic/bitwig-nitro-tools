# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Static key extraction from `bitwig.jar`**, via
  `examples/extract_keys_from_jar.py`. All three keys (Dag, `nitro-image` and
  `nitro-std`) are `byte[]` literals in the jar, built by bytecode
  (`newarray byte` plus one `bastore` per element) rather than stored as
  contiguous bytes, which is why searching the jars for them finds nothing in
  any encoding. The script reads the arrays out of the bytecode and verifies
  each candidate against your own installed archives before reporting it;
  nothing is printed as hex unless you pass `--hex`. Every class is looked at,
  but only the 281 of 31,476 that contain a `newarray byte` opcode are walked,
  and no candidate can hide behind that filter, because the pattern being
  matched starts with those two bytes. Ships no keys. Verified on Bitwig 5.1.9
  and 6.1, which carry byte-identical values for all three: 517/517
  `nitro-image` members decompile on 6.1, 121/121 `nitro-std` members decrypt
  to valid Nitro source, and factory `0004` document metadata parses.

### Changed

- **`docs/KEY_EXTRACTION.md` and the README document the static route**, next
  to the live-JVM controllers, which are unchanged.
- `nitro-decrypt-std`'s docstring describes `nitro-std` as the same Dag cipher
  as `nitro-image`, under a 96-byte key with a 192-byte IV. The command itself
  is unchanged.
- Documented that a 5.1.9 `nitro-image` decrypts correctly under this key but
  does not decompile: the nitrobin container gained a field between 5.1.9 and
  6.1. That is a format-version gap in the decompiler, not a key failure.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **`nitro-std` stdlib source decryption** via a new bundled controller,
  **Nitro Std Dump** (`BitwigNitroStdDump.control.js`), and the
  `nitro-decrypt-std` CLI. Unlike `nitro-image` (offline, self-inverse Dag
  cipher), each `nitro-std` member is wrapped in a runtime PRNG stream cipher
  that is not reproducible offline; the controller decrypts the whole archive
  inside a live Bitwig JVM — via `NitroFile`'s `(ctx, byte[]) -> java.io.Reader`
  source-decrypt method, discovered by shape — and writes the plaintext tree to
  your disk. `nitro-decrypt-std --install-controller` copies it in;
  `nitro-decrypt-std` verifies + reports the result. New path resolvers:
  `nitro_std_install_path`, `nitro_std_output_dir`, `nitro_std_manifest_path`.
  Ships no keys and no decrypted content. Decrypt mechanism verified on
  Bitwig 6.0.11 (121/121 members).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **Runtime key extraction via a bundled controller.** `nitro-extract-keys
  --install-controller` copies the bundled `BitwigNitroKeyDump.control.js`
  controller (shipped as package data) into Bitwig's Controller Scripts
  directory (override with `--controllers-dir`).
  Loading it in Bitwig reflects over the running engine and writes a key dump to
  `~/.bitwig-nitro/nitro-key-dump.json` (override with `BITWIG_NITRO_KEYDUMP`).
  `nitro-extract-keys --live` reads that dump, selects and — against an
  installed `nitro-image` — validates the nitro-image key, then writes
  `keys.json` (`--image` points at a specific image; `--force` writes despite a
  failed validation). Verified end-to-end on Bitwig 6.0.11: the controller loads
  and dumps the cipher chain (with IV sizes), and `--live` selects the key by IV
  size `198` and validates it against the installed nitro-image.

### Changed

- **Corrected the key-recovery docs.** `docs/KEY_EXTRACTION.md` and the README
  previously implied the nitro-image key was statically recoverable from a
  transform-chain definition in `bitwig.jar`. Verified false: neither the
  nitro-image key nor the Dag key appears in `bitwig.jar`, `libs.jar`, or
  `lwjgl.jar` in any form (raw, hex, or base64), nor in the native binaries —
  both are materialized only at runtime, so static jar recovery is impossible.
  The docs now describe the bundled-controller flow as the proven route, label
  live verification as the user's own step, and keep the transform-chain
  disassembly only as structure-only background.
- Documented the `BITWIG_NITRO_CONFIG` override for the per-user config
  directory that holds `keys.json`, in `docs/KEY_EXTRACTION.md`, the README, and
  the `nitro-extract-keys --out` help text.

### Fixed

- **Write guard now covers the whole program-install directory.** `write_image`
  refused writes under `<install>/Library` but not a sibling of `Library` inside
  the install (for example `/opt/bitwig-studio/other`). `is_inside_install` now
  guards each install root's parent as well, while skipping a filesystem-anchor
  parent so a bare `/Library` root can never disable writes globally.

### Removed

- Dropped the `--from-jar` flag from `nitro-extract-keys`; it advertised a
  static-recovery path that does not exist.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-12

Initial public release. A standard-library-only toolchain for working with
Bitwig's Nitro DSP binary format, offline, on your own machine.

### Added

- **`dag_cipher`**: Dag stream cipher for Bitwig `0004`-encoded files:
  `dag_decrypt`, `decrypt_0004`, `read_encrypted_btwg`. Ships no keys.
- **`keys`**: runtime key resolution (`resolve_dag_key`,
  `resolve_nitro_image_key`, `write_keys_file`, `MissingKeyError`). Keys come
  from environment variables or a local `keys.json`; a `MissingKeyError` names
  the variable to set when a key is absent. No key is ever embedded as a
  default.
- **`paths`**: install and data-path discovery (`packaged_data_dir`,
  `bitwig_install_roots`, `nitro_image_install_path`, `keys_search_paths`,
  `local_output_dir`).
- **`nitro_image`**: read, decrypt, encrypt, and repack the `nitro-image`
  archive of per-entry-encrypted DSP modules (`read_image`, `read_entry`,
  `write_image`, `decrypt_entry`, `encrypt_entry`, `NitroImage`).
- **`nitrobin_parser`**: faithful binary reader for `.nitrobin` files
  (`parse_nitrobin`, `parse_nitrobin_file`, `parse_all`, `NitroBinModule`).
- **`nitrobin_writer`**: serializer that round-trips a parsed tree back to
  bytes (`serialize_nitrobin`, `serialize_nitrobin_file`).
- **`nitrobin_decompiler`**: spec-driven full-AST decompiler
  (`decompile_nitrobin`, `decompile_nitrobin_file`, `AstNode`).
- **`nitro_pretty`**: pretty-printer that emits readable pseudo-source from a
  decompiled AST (`pretty_print`).
- **`nitro_edit`**: locate and mutate numeric literals in a compiled module
  with a same-size guarantee (`find_constants`, `get_constant`, `set_constant`,
  `mutate_constant_bytes`, `ConstantRef`, and path helpers).
- **`nitro_builder`**: small AST construction helpers for building nodes by
  hand (`int_lit`, `float_lit`, `bool_lit`, `str_lit`, `id_`, `block`, `add`,
  `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `list_builders`, `builder_doc`).
- **AST grammar tables**: `nitro_ast_tags.json` and
  `nitro_ast_class_methods.json` bundled as package data; regenerable via the
  `nitro-build-ast-tables` command.
- **Command line tools**: `nitro-decompile`, `nitro-extract-keys`,
  `nitro-decrypt-corpus`, `nitro-build-atlas`, `nitro-build-ast-tables`,
  `nitro-validate`.
- **Docs**: format specs for the Nitro binary protocol and the reverse
  engineering notes behind the toolchain, plus `docs/KEY_EXTRACTION.md` for
  bringing your own keys.

### Notes

- Runtime code depends on the Python standard library only.
- The project redistributes no Bitwig cipher keys and no decrypted Bitwig
  content. Decryption is bring-your-own-install.
